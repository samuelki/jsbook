# JSBook

This project is a dynamic JavaScript coding enviornment similar to the Jupyter Notebook. There is a text cell where you may click to turn into a markdown editor and a code cell where you may write JavaScript to see it executed in an adjacent preview window.

- The code in each cell is bundled together into one file (defining a variable in one cell may be referenced in another)
- You may show any React component, string, number, or element by calling the `show` function (a function built into this environment)
